We explored single-modal bias by revealing the inner working of multi-modal fusion and achieved a generic framework EliMRec so as to eliminate single-modal bias in multimedia recommendation.

## Installation

The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* torch==1.7.0
* numpy==1.16.1
* torch_geometric==1.6.1

## Data download
We provide three processed datasets: Kwai, Tiktok, and Movielnes.  
- You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via [Kwai](https://www.kuaishou.com/activity/uimc), [Tiktok](http://ai-lab-challenge.bytedance.com/tce/vc/), and [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
Since the copyright of datasets, we cannot release them directly. 

## Run EliMRec
The hyper-parameters used to train the models are set as default in the `conf/EliMRec.properties`. Feel free to change them if needed.

```sh
python3 main.py --recommender="EliMRec" --data.input.dataset=tiktok
```
